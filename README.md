## Why this exists

Slides are usually built in PowerPoint, Keynote, or Google Slides. Those tools are great if you like dragging text boxes. They're terrible if you want to:

- Treat your deck like a document you can *write*, not a canvas you have to *arrange*
- Pair with an AI assistant to draft, edit, and iterate
- Keep your slides in version control
- Embed your deck anywhere with a single iframe
- Print to PDF without losing fidelity
- Stop fighting auto-formatting

This framework is a single HTML file with a library of 21 components. You edit it like a webpage. You present it in a browser. You pair with an AI assistant to write slides through conversation.

## Quick start

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/noskillish/slides.git
   cd slides
   ```

2. **Open `deck.html` in your browser.** You'll see the template with examples of every component.

3. **Open the file in your editor** (with Claude Code, Cursor, or whatever you like).

4. **Edit the slides.** Each slide is a `<section class="slide">`. Copy any one to make a new one.

5. **Drop media** into `media/` and reference with relative paths.

6. **Present** in full-screen (F11). Navigate with arrow keys or swipe on touch devices.

7. **Export to PDF** by clicking the button or pressing `P`.

## AI workflow

This template was made with AI assistance in mind. The workflow:

1. Open the repo in your editor with your AI assistant running.
2. Tell it what slide you want: *"Add a quote slide that says 'Coding is solved' as the opening."*
3. The AI inserts a slide using the right component.
4. Iterate by feedback: *"Make it dark."* *"Move it to slide 3."* *"Shorten the headline."*
5. Drop in media as you go: *"Wire `media/demo.mp4` to the collage on slide 8 with controls."*

The AI reads `AGENTS.md` to understand the design system, all 21 components, the storytelling framework, and the tone rules. It can also freestyle new components as long as they stay on-token.

See [docs/USING.md](docs/USING.md) for the full workflow.

## Embedding

Add `?embed` to any deck URL and drop it in an iframe. The PDF button hides; navigation stays.

```html
<iframe src="your-deck.html?embed" style="width:100%; aspect-ratio:16/9; border:none;"></iframe>
```

Works in blog posts, Notion, documentation sites, or anywhere that renders HTML.

## Tech

- **One HTML file per deck.** No JavaScript framework. No build step. No npm install.
- **Self-contained.** `deck.html` and `design-system.html` have zero external dependencies beyond Google Fonts (Inter).
- **`index.html` is the landing page.** It uses the Tailwind CDN for responsive layout — it's a marketing page, not a deck file. The product files stay dependency-free.
- **Works in any modern browser.** Present, share, embed.
- **PDF export** via `window.print()` with print-optimized CSS (`@page` set to 16:9).
- **Auto-deploy** to GitHub Pages on push to `main` via the included GitHub Action.

## Credits

Built originally for a specific talk and generalized for anyone who wants to present with less friction. Inspired by editorial layouts and the broader minimalist tradition in tech writing.
