# slides

A minimalist, AI-friendly slide deck framework. One HTML file. No build step. Pair it with Claude Code (or your editor of choice) and write decks like prose.

## Why this exists

Slides are usually built in PowerPoint, Keynote, or Google Slides. Those tools are great if you like dragging text boxes. They're terrible if you want to:

- Treat your deck like a document you can *write*, not a canvas you have to *arrange*
- Pair with an AI assistant to draft, edit, and iterate
- Keep your slides in version control
- Print to PDF without losing fidelity
- Stop fighting auto-formatting

This framework is a single HTML file with a small library of components. You edit it like a webpage. You present it in a browser. You pair with Claude Code (or any AI assistant) to write slides through prompts.

## Quick start

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/noskillish/slides.git
   cd slides
   ```

2. **Open `deck.html` in your browser.** You'll see the template with examples of every component.

3. **Open the file in your editor** (with Claude Code, Cursor, or whatever you like).

4. **Edit the slides.** Each slide is a `<section class="slide">`. Copy any one to make a new one.

5. **Drop media** into `media/` and reference with relative paths.

6. **Present** in full-screen (F11), navigate with arrow keys.

7. **Export to PDF** by clicking the button or pressing `P`.

## The Claude Code workflow

This template was made with AI assistance in mind. The workflow:

1. Open the repo in your editor with Claude Code running.
2. Tell Claude what slide you want: *"Add a quote slide that says 'Coding is solved' as the opening."*
3. Claude inserts a slide using the right component.
4. Iterate by feedback: *"Make it dark."* *"Move it to slide 3."* *"Shorten the headline."*
5. Drop in media as you go: *"Wire `media/demo.mp4` to the collage on slide 8 with controls."*

The components are the vocabulary. You write the deck like you'd write the talk. See [docs/USING.md](docs/USING.md) for the full workflow.

## Credits

Inspired by editorial layouts (mockups.directory, NYT) and the broader minimalist tradition in tech writing. Built originally for a specific talk and generalized for anyone who wants to present with less friction.
